Movie Database React

*** Currently in progress NOT FINISHED for a more complete version look at the Express Version ***

This project is my project to chnage my express movie database into React form. The movie datbase is essentially a copy of IMDB. 

## Features already implemented ##

Redux and Hook implemented through most the component, plan to eventually change most if not all components to functions
# PS Because this uses a beta version of react please run the following command on the frontend: npm i react@next react-router@next --save

Basic functionality of search and specific movielist now made. 

## Features to implement ##

User base and authentication using Passport.js, bcrypt, express-sessions
<br>
Connect to a database (Mongo) to store user favorites and other info
<br>
Finish up the actor side and polish movie list and details pages.
